// Module 8's receiving half — item 28, "communication er kono part e kaaj
// korche na".
//
// Nothing here was broken. `CommunicationService` writes memos, voice memos
// and snapshot requests correctly; the Firestore rules for
// `communications/{uid}/messages` pass for both parties; `redeemCode` sets
// `pairedUserId` on both profiles in one transaction. All of that was checked
// before a line was written.
//
// The gap was that `communicationsStreamProvider` was referenced only from
// inside `lib/features/guardian/` — the caretaker's own UI. The messages were
// written and nobody on the other device was listening.
